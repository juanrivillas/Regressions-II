Today's session will focus on data taken from the [Nutrition and Aging survey] project.

Five main steps are described in this markdown. 

**Step 1. Preparing work space (import dataset)**. This step includes:
        Working directory and loading of packages required for the tidying data.
        Importing data base.
        Verifying upload and exploring data base.

**Step 2: Overview of the entire dataset **
        data structure and complete rates 
        computing frequency tables
        missing values and outliers
              
**Step 3: Visualizing data** 
        Look at the dispersion of data: Histograms, scatterplot & violin plots

**Step 4: Use table functions to compare groups and describe study population**
        Baseline characteristics of population study
        Vector transformation
        
**Step 5: Exercise**


# Introduction

This workshop introduces the [tidyverse](https://www.tidyverse.org/) packages, which support data processing and visualisation in R. All of these packages share the same concepts of data handling, which makes it easier to build workflows that move between different kinds of task:

- Reading tabular data (with `readr`)
- Tidying data (with `tidyr`)
- Transforming data (with `dplyr`)
- Data visualization (with `ggplot2`)

This workshop assumes a basic familiarity with the R language, otherwise it is higly recommended to look at the introductory *R Programming* material in the suggested books/materials.

## R notebooks

This document is an example of an *R notebook*, which combines text and code and makes it easy to embed R analysis within a report (ouput as HTML, PDF, Word document or presentation slides). This can help to make research more reproducible by allowing you to share an entire analysis workflow together with a narrative.

When you open the notebook's source code (*.Rmd* file) in RStudio, you can view and edit it in the editor window.

Text is formatted using the [R markdown](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/) notation, which is derived from [Markdown](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet). This is a simple way to apply styling to text and indicate the structure of your document.

When the cursor is inside a chunk, you can execute the code using *Ctrl-Shift-Enter*. The commands and output appear in the console window as if the chunk had been copy-pasted there. The output also appears in the notebook just after the chunk.

A notebook is a living document. You are encouraged to make use of this notebook to try out the example code, alter it, complete the exercises and add your own notes and code chunks. You can insert a new code chunk using the shortcut _Ctrl+Alt+I_.

R code is included as *chunks*, which look like this:

```{r}
## R code lives here
print("Hello RStudio!")
```


**Step 1. Preparing work space (import dataset)**

#Before you start work, please check your working directory and assign file pathway to save automatically plots and outcomes in pdf format.

```{r}
## Working directory
getwd()

setwd("/Users/macbookpro/Documents/U Groningen/")

setwd("~/Documents/U Groningen/Regressions II")

print(getwd())
```
```

You can change the working directory using the files window in RStudio (bottom right).
Navigate to the directory containing the workshop data and click the cog icon for the "Set as Working Directory" option.

##loading of packages required for the tidying data

Tidy data has the three following attributes:

1. Every column is a variable
2. Every row is an observation (also known as a "case")
3. Every cell holds a single value

When data is tidy, we can visualise and analyse it more easily.

About packages: Many useful R functions are developed by individuals and research groups and made available to the community as *packages*.

You can find a full list of R packages at the [CRAN](https://cran.r-project.org/) page.

The tidyverse packages and R Markdown are installed with:

```{r}
install.packages ("tidyverse")
install.packages("rmarkdown")
```

R Markdown provides an authoring framework for data science. You can use a single R Markdown file to both

-save and execute code
-generate high quality reports that can be shared with an audience


and loaded into the workspace with:

```{r eval=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
library(rmarkdown)
```

Note that this command loads all of the core tidyverse packages, but you can also load them individually as necessary.

#load you data and check your data was loaded

```{r}
library(readxl)
ineqdata <- read_excel("~/Documents/U Groningen/Regressions II/Datasets/ineqdata.xlsx")
View(ineqdata)
```


Other option to check loaded data (just call dataset by assigned name):

```{}
ineqdata
```

We can get a quick overview of the data using the `str()` function:

```{}
str(ineqdata)
```

Check first and last observations in the dataset

```{r eval=FALSE, include=FALSE}
head(ineqdata)
tail(ineqdata)
dim(ineqdata)
```

Â£Checking missing values in the dataset

#Loading packages to work with missing values
#Load packages for descriptive analysis of missingness

```{r}
install.packages ("mice")
install.packages ("naniar")

install.packages ("VIM")

library(mice)    #Loading the mice package
library(VIM)     #VIM introduces tools for visualization of missing and imputed values.
library (naniar) #tidy ways to summarise, visualize, and manipulate misisng data.
```

We can check the amount of missing data in all data.frames:

```{r}
skimr::skim(ineqdata)
```

Interpretation:
There are -- columns. A first glance there are -- character variables and -- numeric variables. There are -- variables with not missing value, there are -- variables with --% missing values (x and y), and one columns with --% missing values (z).


```{r}
# Are there missing values in the dataset?
any_na(ineqdata)

# How many?
n_miss(ineqdata)
prop_miss(ineqdata)
```

You have three options dealing with NA: 
1) imputation (not time and quite complex)
2) Apply a complete case strategy (excluding NAs) or 
3) Elliminate variables or observations with NAs with risk to biased your results (reducing statistical power)

#elliminate NA in the dataset
```{r}
#is.na() function first looks for na values in a column and then discards such rows.

#For continuos variables
ineqdata$education[is.na(ineqdata$education)] <- mean(ineqdata$education, na.rm=TRUE)

#For all variables to remove NAs values in vars.
ineqdata1    <- na.omit(ineqdata) #this dataset includes complete case (removed education n=13 and one observation with incomplete in the var "physical activity") 
data4    <- na.omit(data1) #This dataset includes complete case (removind all NA and leaving occupation)

View(ineqdata1)
skimr::skim(ineqdata1)

```


## Step 3. Visualising data**

Load libraries to produce nice graphs
```{r}
library(ggplot2)             #Descriptive stats and data viz
library(ggstatsplot)         #Basic stats and inference stats plots
```

Having loaded some numerical data, a sensible first step is to visualise the distributions of variables to check for any issues.

Although there are many useful plotting functions available in base R, in this session we will focus on making plots using the tidyverse package `ggplot2`. This is a very powerful set of functions that support a consistent approach to data visualisation. `ggplot2` makes it much easier to create high-quality graphics for presentations and publications.


## Histogram

Let's start with a histogram for the GDP data from the `totchol` tibble:

```{r}
hist(ineqdata$age)
```

```{r}
hist(ineqdata$bmi)
```

Histograms of biomarkers
```{}

gghistostats(
  data       = ineqdata,
  x          = age,
  title      = "Histogram of age of individual in sample data",
  test.value = 12,
  binwidth   = 6
)
```


```{r echo=TRUE}

gghistostats(
  data       = ineqdata,
  x          = totchol,
  title      = "Histogram glucose",
  test.value = 12,
  binwidth   = 6
)
```

## Violin plot

Notice that there are two steps to creating the plot. 

The first line constructs the data space by specifying the dataset (`ineqdata`) and the variable(s) of interest 
(in this case, just `education and BMI`). This function controls the *aesthetic mappings* used by `ggplot2`, i.e. the way in which the data will be mapped to visual elements. 


The `ggplot2` defaults for axes, labels etc. are usually informative enough for data exploration, but of course everything can be modified if necessary.

For example, to add at title, change the histogram colour and show population on a log scale:

```{r}

ggbetweenstats(
  data  = ineqdata,
  x     = gender,
  y     = bmi, fill = gender,
  title = "Distribution of body mass index across sex groups"
)
```

Find distribution of people with alcohol consumption by body mas index
```{r}
set.seed(123)

ggbetweenstats(
  data  = ineqdata,
  x     = alcohol,
  y     = bmi, fill = alcohol,
  title = "Distribution of body mass index across sex groups"
)
```


Find distribution of people exposed to extreme changes weather by glucose
```{r}
ggbetweenstats(
  data  = ineqdata,
  x     = extreme_weather,
  y     = bmi, fill = extreme_weather,
  title = "Distribution of body mass index across sex groups"
)
```

## Saving plots to file

We can save the last plot made to a file using

```{r}
ggsave("my_histogram.pdf")
```
The file type is determined by the file extension and the size of the image can be changed using `width` and `height` options.


## Scatter plot

We can visualise covariation between variables using a scatter plot, for example GDP vs population. This uses `geom_point()`:

```{r}

ggplot(ineqdata, aes(x=bmi, y=totchol)) + 
  geom_point() + 
  scale_x_log10() + 
  scale_y_log10() 

```


```{r}
ggplot(ineqdata, aes(x=glucose, y=age)) + 
  geom_point() + 
  scale_x_log10() + 
  scale_y_log10() 

```


```{r}
ggplot(ineqdata, aes(x=bmi, y=biological_age)) + 
  geom_point() + 
  scale_x_log10() + 
  scale_y_log10() 

```

The [ggplot2 cheat sheet](https://github.com/rstudio/cheatsheets/raw/master/data-visualization-2.1.pdf) gives much more information about plotting options.


Step 4: Exploring and manipulating data using table functions

#Manipulating data (**dplyr**)

The [dplyr]() package deals with many types of data manipulation that are needed as part of any analysis workflow. 

Load libraries
```{r}
library(table1)     #to Create HTML Tables of Descriptive Statistics in epi
library(gtsummary)

install.packages("DescTools")
library(DescTools)  #single and cumulative frequencies values are reported.
```

# Check distribution and frequency of data

By setting `na.rm=TRUE`, we discard the cells that did not contain observations.

```{r}
Freq(ineqdata$bmi, useNA = "always")

Desc(ineqdata$gender)
Freq(ineqdata$gender, useNAs=always)  
```


#Check using tables functions

```{r}
table(ineqdata$gender)
```

Using Table 1 (very helpful to produce tables with %, CI, counts, p values)

```{r}
table_test <- table1(~education | gender, data=ineqdata)

table_test
```

#Use table functions more advanced, for instance compareGroups

Load packages
```{r}
install.packages("compareGroups")
library(compareGroups)
```


```{r}
table_test <- compareGroups( data = ineq, 
               formula = diabetes ~ gender + malnutrition + education)

table_test_ci <- createTable(x = table_test, show.ci = T, show.n = T, show.all = T )

export2word( x = table_test_ci, file = '/Users/macbookpro/Documents/U Groningen/Regressions II/table_test_ci.docx')

table_test_ci
```


Save bew dataset
```{r}
export2word( x = ineq2, file = '/Users/macbookpro/Documents/PhD Project/Data/SABE/Outputs/ineq2.docx')
```

## Changing data type

as factor
as numeric
as integers

```{r}
#Rename values in the health outcomes columns and create a vectors of diseases
biomarkers.imp$cvd <- factor(biomarkers.imp$cvd,
                levels = c("1","2","8","9"),
                labels = c("1","0", "0","0"))
                
biomarkers.imp$hta <- factor(biomarkers.imp$hta,
                levels = c("1","2","8","9"),
                labels = c("1","0", "0","0"))
                
biomarkers.imp$diabetes <- factor(biomarkers.imp$diabetes,
                levels = c("1","2","8","9"),
                labels = c("1","0", "0","0"))
                
```



#### Exercise

Visualise the distribution of the new variable `Age`.

```{r}



```

Find the mestizo population in the data, then identify females with diabetes

```{r}



```

### Exploring structure of data

We can look and extract information about charcateristics of data using str() and skim ()

```{r}


```


### Table1 ()

Use `table1()` to generate a table with socioeconomic charcateristics of population filtered by gender

```{r}



```


## gghistostats ()

Use gghistostats () function to look at the distibution of BMI and age of participants plotting a histogram.


```{r}


```

## ggbetweenstats ()

Find the mean of adult SEP separately females and males using a violing plot

```{r}


```

rebame levels of diabetes : healthy unhealty

```{r}


```
